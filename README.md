## Problem Statement
In today’s world social media drives so many different things, from social justice to stocks. We really saw the power of social media on stocks this year, GameStop Corp’s stock increased 2,400% in just 2 months all because some people on Reddit wanted it to. While GameStop took most of the spotlight there were countless other companies that sky rocketed out of nowhere, helping some stay alive and pivot their business models. This isn’t a new phenomenon, back in 2018 a simple tweet from Kylie Jenner was a factor in Snap Inc. dropping 7% in one day. While this is an interesting problem to tackle there is a similar problem that exists in regards to the relationship of companies and social media. For the normal person, that isn’t a savvy stock trader, their view of a company is based on the few and far between news articles about something bad a company did. When in reality people are talking about companies and products all the time on social media. This chatter is almost always lost in the overwhelming amount of other posts on social media. Companies also rely on customer reviews of products and surveys to guide other customers to the right product, the problem with that is there are a select group of people that take the time to review a product on the company website. This means the company and the consumer are missing out on valuable data that is being posted on social media about their products. A company would be able to adjust before something catastrophic happens with the company as a whole or an individual product if they had live data on what people were saying on social media. Giving a company the ability to watch a trend of social media posts would tell them what the world is truly thinking. This wouldn’t only help large companies get ahead of problems or better determine what they are doing right, it would also help the consumer to make more informed purchases based on product sentiment and company sentiment from social media.

## Solution
A solution to this problem is to create a site anyone can enter a company name or product into and see the overall sentiment analysis of that product or company based on social media posts. Once a company or product is entered a scraper will be sent out to gather as much recent social media data as possible then each post will be run through a sentiment analysis to get an aggregate sentiment and determine the overall view of the company or product, as well as provide a selection of posts that helped drive that sentiment analysis. The analysis can be tweaked to more heavily weight posts by more popular accounts or in later iterations posts by more consistent accounts. Historical data can also be stored to create trend lines for companies or products. Other than the main search view other views like popular companies (i.e. Walmart, Amazon, Google, etc…), biggest sentiment fluctuations, and most talked about can be incorporated. For the popular companies view an automated scraper can be sent out in certain intervals to gather and analyze those posts. The biggest sentiment fluctuations view can be created from analyzing historical data from popular companies and past searches. The most talked about view would simply take a list of publicly traded companies, and possibly large private companies like Walmart, and rank them based on how many posts included them, no sentiment analysis needed. If the user wants more detail on a most talked about company they could simply click it and get the sentiment analysis for it. In the first iteration this solution would only apply to Twitter, in later iterations it will branch out to Facebook, Instagram, and Reddit.
